2016 Summer Internship 'Team Intern Project' Final Presentation Slides

During my summer internship at FlowJo, LLC, I was given the opportunity to experience the software development process. The intern team was comprised of five summer interns. We were assigned to a software project to begin working on from the ground up. We were involved in an authetic software design process. 

###Major components of our process
1. The interns split into 3 different departments (QA, Engineers, and DevOps) 
2. We were given a requirements document for the project
3. As a group, we determined what we could achieve in our timeframe
4. We engaged in a 'push back' discussion with the writers of the requirements 
   doucuement to agree on what will be completed in the timeframe
5. The Engineering and QA department created a specification document for the project
6. The 3 different departments communicated daily to make progress on the project 
7. We used industry tools (JIRA, LiquidPlanner, Docker, Jenkins) 
8. We had weekly status meetings with directors to report progress and discuss problems

The PowerPoint document in this repo is from the intern team's final presentation. I was part of the QA deparment.
